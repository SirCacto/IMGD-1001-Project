Stephen is back in the History classroom.
Mr. Washington: Mr. Huburt? Are you paying attention back there?
Stephen: Oh! Yes! Sorry, I think I zoned out for a moment there.
Mr. Washington: Then you can’t answer my question?
Stephen: No, sir.
Mr. Washington: Alright then. I expect better from you, Stephen. Let’s see we can focus a bit more, okay?
